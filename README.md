# skeleton-plus
ZF2 Skeleton plus ZfcUser plus core services

## Aim
The aim of skeleton-plus is to create a Zend 2 foundation project including core modules common to typical applications. The personal aim is to improve my own understanding of ZF2 through the design and build of a practically useful foundation platform. 

## Core Modules & Services
Core modules will include pre-existing modules where available (e.g. ZfcUser) along with base UIs.  The project will be RESTful, using Apigility for API creation and documentation.

Modules may include some or all of the following:
* User sign up / authentication / login
* Social sign up / authentication / login - Oauth
* Admin login / reporting
* Account settings and preferences
* Personal messaging
* Posting / commenting
* Notifications and alerts

The project will aim to use SOLID principles and TDD, not only for maintainability but also for the learning experience of doing things the right way.
